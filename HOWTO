1. Whatsminer upgrade package contains below files:

   - remote-upgrade.sh: upgrade script.
   - upgrade-whatsminer-$MACHINE_TYPE-$VERSION_NUMBER.tgz: upgrade package.
   - HOWTO: this file.

2. First prepare your Miners IP list file ip.txt (one IP each line).

   $ cat ip.txt
   192.168.1.10
   192.168.1.11
   ..
   192.168.0.100
   192.168.0.101

3. Then run remote-upgrade.sh to upgrade the specified miners.

  $ ./remote-upgrade.sh upgrade-whatsminer-$MACHINE_TYPE-$VERSION_NUMBER.tgz ip.txt

  This command will upgrade miners specified in ip.txt automatically.
  After one miner finishes the upgrade, the miner will reboot automatically.

  Enjoy it!
